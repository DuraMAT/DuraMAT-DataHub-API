# DuraMAT-DataHub-API

The enclosed python notebook will act as a tutorial and template for learning some simple methods for accessing the DuraMAT Energy Material Network Data Hub. With a little bit of tweaking it can also be used to access any of the EMN Data hubs or for accessing any site using 2.6+ version of the CKAN Data Sharing platform.

The notebook was built using the python 3.7 environment.
